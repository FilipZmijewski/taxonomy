## Validation process

1. Complete the BadgeMe application form (in English), review it with your mentor (if applicable) and then save as a PDF for your records and submit when ready. Any attachments to your application must also be in English.

• You must attach your Project Profile evaluation forms as received from your SME review. If you do not have any of these approval forms, please review the information on Project Profiles before continuing.

2. The application will be assigned to one Subject Matter Expert (SME) to review, who may also interview the candidate (interview is not mandatory). The SME assignment may take a couple of weeks to determine. The candidate should schedule the SME interview.

3. The SME may approve, decline or return the application for review. If the SME declines, a second SME may be invited.

4. If the verdicts were not unanimous, a third SME may be involved as a tie-breaker if necessary. Only the first SME has the option to return the form for revisions.

5. Overall, expect this process to take around 8 weeks. You will not have access to the form except if it is returned for revision. Check Badge Application Status to view the stage your form is in. If you have questions during this time, you may send an email to srepro@us.ibm.com.

6. If/ when your certification application is approved, you will receive an automatic notification from Acclaim (admin@youracclaim.com) with instructions to accept your badge.

7. Proudly display your badge on social media and on your email signature.

## Validation rigor

• 1 Subject Matter Expert (SME) review.

## What's next?

Become prepared for your next career milestone and apply for Level 2 - Expert certification in the future!

You don't need the Level 1 Certification as a prerequisite for Level 2. The Level-2 Fastpath allows practitioners to approach Level-2 directly. However, this fastpath has an additional requirement on a second specialty badge, unlike the "standard" Level-2. This is to take into account the fact that Level-1 already requires one specialty badge.
